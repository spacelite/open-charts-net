#summary Basic chart

First, you should have a chart component on your form. If you don't have it, just copy a source code into your windows forms application and build it.

Simple chart code:

{{{
chart1.xAxis.Categories = new string[] { "1", "2", "3" };
chart1.Series = new Series[] 
{
   new cSeries() { Name = "Series1", Data = new string[] { "0,1", "", "" }, Type = cSeries.eType.Column },
   new cSeries() { Name = "Series2", Data = new string[] { "1", "3", "2" }, Type = cSeries.eType.Area }
}
}}}

Yep, thats all.
